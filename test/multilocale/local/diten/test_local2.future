feature: Deprecate local blocks

Turn off the local block assertion because now that we are passing more things by
reference, applying the local optimization can get the wrong answer.

There is a plan to deprecate local blocks sooner or later anyway.  They may be reinstated,
but for now are disabled on the AMM branch.
