optimization: Unused string literals not removed.

This test used to pass because the code in the dead branch of a param conditional was
removed, taking the definition of the string literal with it.  Now string literals are
dropped into their own module.  So even when all of a literal's uses are in code that is
removed, the literal itself persists.

This test was copied from the original foldUintZeroes, which tests that param folding is
done correctly.  That test was updated to more accurately determine that the folding part
works.
